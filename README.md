# Welcome at web:frametwo
## About us:
web:frametwo is a little neubrutalism CSS Framework. The whole Framework is developed by a german developer called Satistile. All properties of this Framework are optimized to work perfectly with a Font called spaceGrotesk. But more about that topic is in the documentation. The Framework will work with other fonts, but perhaps it doesn't fit as anticipated. We hope, web:frametwo is helpful.
